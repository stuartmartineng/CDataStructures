# CDataStructures
This is a repository currently under development containing various data structure programmed in the C programming language.

## Data Structures
### Queue
A FIFO Queue.

### Stack
A FILO Stack.

### Linked List
A doubly linked list.

Contains a sequential search algorithm O(n).  A faster algorithm could not be used due to the slow random access of a linked list.
 
A mergesort O(nlogn) is used for sort.  Mergesort was selected due to the slow random access of a linked list.

## Testing
Unit test are written for all Data Structures using Unity.
